Offside Rule
The offside rule is one of the most misunderstood parts of soccer, especially for beginners. A player is considered offside if they are in the opponent’s half and closer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender at the moment a teammate passes the ball to them. Being in an offside position by itself is not a foul. The player is only penalized if they are actively involved in the play meaning they receive the ball, interfere with an opponent, or gain an advantage from being ahead.
To visualize it simply, imagine the attacking player standing behind the defenders waiting for a long pass. If the ball is played to them while they are beyond the defensive line, the assistant referee raises the flag, and the play is stopped for an offside infraction. The defending team is then awarded an indirect free kick.
The rule helps prevent “goal hanging,” where attackers stay near the goal the entire match without participating in normal play. It encourages teamwork, passing, and movement rather than relying on long, hopeful balls. Because timing is so important, many attackers try to “time their run” so they start behind the defenders and sprint forward just as the pass is made. Modern soccer uses VAR technology in many competitions to review close offside decisions, although at recreational or youth levels, the assistant referee’s flag remains the primary method of enforcement.
