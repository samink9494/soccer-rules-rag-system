Goalkeeper Rules and Handling Restrictions
The goalkeeper has special privileges, but only in their own penalty area. They are the only player allowed to use their hands to stop or catch the ball during active play. However, certain limitations apply. A goalkeeper cannot pick up the ball if it was deliberately passed to them using a teammate’s foot. This action is known as a back-pass violation. If the goalkeeper handles such a pass, the opposing team receives an indirect free kick inside the penalty area.
Goalkeepers must also release the ball within a reasonable amount of time, usually around six seconds. Holding the ball too long leads to an indirect free kick for the other team. When catching high balls or attempting punches during set pieces, goalkeepers are protected from unfair physical contact. Opponents cannot charge or block them while they are in the air or attempting to secure the ball.
Outside the penalty area, a goalkeeper becomes just like any other outfield player. They cannot use their hands and must rely on their feet to play the ball. Many modern goalkeepers act as “sweepers,” clearing through balls and participating in their team’s buildup. However, stepping out of the box unintentionally while holding the ball can result in a direct free kick for the opponent. Goalkeepers must be aware of their position and make quick decisions to avoid costly mistakes.
