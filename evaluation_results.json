      "question": "How long is a standard soccer match and what is the purpose of stoppage time?",
      "answer": " A standard soccer match lasts 90 minutes, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each. The purpose of stoppage time (also known as added time or injury time) is to account for interruptions during normal play, such as when the ball goes out of bounds, a player gets injured, or substitutions occur. The referee keeps track of all these interruptions and adds the extra time at the end of each half. The exact length of stoppage time can vary depending on the duration of the delays.",

      "question": "Why might a team target the wings instead of the center?",
      "answer": " In the given context, it doesn't explicitly explain why a team might target the wings instead of the center. However, traditionally, soccer strategies often involve targeting the wings because they provide more space to exploit and offer opportunities for crosses into the penalty area, potentially leading to scoring chances. The center, on the other hand, is usually more crowded due to multiple players from both teams concentrating there. But without additional context about the specific situation or team tactics, it's hard to definitively say why a team would target the wings over the center.",

      "question": "How does a high defensive line affect offside calls?",
      "answer": " A high defensive line can potentially increase the likelihood of offside calls against the attacking team, as it places the second-last defender closer to the opposing team's half. This means that an attacking player who is further forward than the ball and the second-last defender could be considered offside under the offside rule, especially if they are involved in active play when a teammate passes the ball to them. However, it's important to note that being in an offside position does not automatically result in a foul; only if the player receives the ball, interferes with an opponent, or gains an advantage will an offside call be made.",

This is often done by deliberately committing a careless or reckless act against an opponent, such as tripping, pushing, or kicking, which are considered common fouls.
