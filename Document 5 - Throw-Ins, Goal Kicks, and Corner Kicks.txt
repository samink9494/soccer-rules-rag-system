Throw-Ins, Goal Kicks, and Corner Kicks
When the ball goes completely out of bounds over the touchline, the opposing team of the last player who touched it is awarded a throw-in. The player taking the throw-in must keep both feet on or behind the line and use both hands to deliver the ball from behind their head. Throw-ins cannot be taken with one hand or thrown like a baseball pitch. They must be executed with proper form, or the referee will award the throw-in to the opposing team.
A goal kick occurs when the attacking team last touches the ball and it crosses the defending team’s goal line without entering the goal. The ball is placed anywhere in the goal area, and a defender—often the goalkeeper—kicks it back into play. Opponents are required to stay outside the penalty area until the ball is kicked and leaves the box.
A corner kick happens when the defending team is the last to touch the ball before it crosses their own goal line. The ball is placed in the nearest corner arc, and an attacking player kicks it back into play. Corner kicks are strong scoring opportunities because many players crowd the penalty area to try heading the ball into the net. Teams often have preset plays to make the most of these situations, while defenders try to mark attackers closely and clear the ball quickly.
