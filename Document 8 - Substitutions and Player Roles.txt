Substitutions and Player Roles
Most soccer matches allow a set number of substitutions, although the exact limit depends on the competition. In many leagues, teams may use three to five substitutes during a match. A substitution occurs when a player leaves the field and another player replaces them. The referee must be notified before the change, and the substitute can only enter after the departing player steps completely off the field. Substitutions typically occur during stoppages but may also take place during certain restarts.
Player roles vary widely. Defenders focus on stopping attacks and protecting the goal. They include center backs, fullbacks, and wing-backs. Midfielders link the defense and the attack, controlling possession and distributing passes. Some midfielders specialize in defense, while others act as playmakers. Forwards and strikers aim to score goals and create attacking chances. Many modern players take on flexible roles, switching positions depending on the tactics.
Teams choose different formations, such as 4-3-3 or 4-4-2, depending on their strategy. Coaches adjust positions based on the strengths of their players and the style of the opponent. Good communication and teamwork are essential because roles often overlap in real match situations. Players also need stamina and awareness to transition quickly between defense and attack.
