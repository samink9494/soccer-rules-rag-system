Yellow and Red Cards
Referees use yellow and red cards to control discipline during a match. A yellow card is a caution given to a player for actions such as reckless tackles, dissent, persistent fouling, delay of game, or unsporting behavior. It signals that the player must be more careful moving forward. If a player receives two yellow cards in the same match, the referee shows a red card, and the player is expelled.
A red card immediately sends the player off the field. The team must continue with one fewer player for the remainder of the game, which creates a major disadvantage. Red cards are issued for serious offenses such as violent conduct, denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity with a foul, using abusive language, or extremely dangerous tackles. In some competitions, a straight red card may result in additional match suspensions.
Referees also manage team officials on the sidelines. Coaches or staff can receive yellow or red cards for inappropriate behavior. Cards help maintain control, but referees typically try verbal warnings before escalating to formal discipline. Good teams stay composed, avoid unnecessary aggression, and respect officials to prevent card accumulation. Managing emotions is part of high-level soccer, as one reckless challenge can change the outcome of a match entirely.
