    "### What You'll Learn:\n",
    "- ✅ File I/O (reading documents)\n",
    "- ✅ String manipulation (text chunking)\n",
    "- ✅ Functions and parameters\n",
    "- ✅ Lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- ✅ Loops and conditionals\n",
    "- ✅ Basic calculations and statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Provided for You:\n",
    "- ✅ Embedding model (converts text to numbers)\n",
    "- ✅ Vector database (stores and searches embeddings)\n",
    "- ✅ LLM connection (generates answers)\n",
