Free Kicks and Penalty Kicks
When a foul is committed, the referee awards either a direct or indirect free kick depending on the type of offense. A direct free kick is given for more serious fouls such as tripping, pushing, or handball. From a direct free kick, a player can shoot directly at goal and score without the ball touching another player. Defenders must stand at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is kicked. Teams often use set plays or powerful shots to try scoring from these situations.
An indirect free kick is awarded for less severe offenses, such as dangerous play without contact, a goalkeeper holding the ball too long, or a player blocking the goalkeeper’s release. For an indirect free kick goal to count, the ball must touch another player before entering the net.
A penalty kick is awarded when a foul punishable by a direct free kick occurs inside the defending team’s penalty area. This gives the attacking team a major scoring opportunity. The ball is placed on the penalty spot, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to defend the shot. All other players must stay outside the box, the penalty arc, and behind the penalty spot until the ball is kicked. Once the shooter strikes the ball, it is in play, and teammates may follow up for rebounds if the ball remains on the field. Penalty kicks often decide close matches, especially in tournaments.
