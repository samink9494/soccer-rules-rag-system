Match Duration and Basic Structure
Soccer is played in two halves, and each half lasts 45 minutes in most standard competitions. Together, the full match is 90 minutes of regular time. After the first 45 minutes, the referee gives a short break called halftime, which usually lasts around 15 minutes. Halftime allows the players to rest, receive instructions from their coaches, and adjust their game plan. The clock in soccer does not stop during normal play. It keeps running even if the ball goes out, a player gets injured, or substitutions occur. Instead of pausing the clock, the referee keeps track of all interruptions and adds “stoppage time” at the end of each half. This extra time can vary depending on how long the delays were.
A match begins with a kickoff from the center circle. Teams switch sides at halftime. The goal of the game is simple: score more goals than the opponent. A goal is counted only if the entire ball crosses the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar. Most matches end after the 90 minutes plus stoppage time. However, knockout games such as cup tournaments may go into extra time if the score is tied. Extra time consists of two 15-minute halves. If the tie still remains, the match may be decided through a penalty shootout. These additional stages only apply in competitions where a winner must be declared.
