Field Layout and Equipment Requirements
A standard soccer field is rectangular and marked with white lines. The touchlines run along the length of the field, while the goal lines mark the shorter ends. At each end, a goal frame stands in the center of the goal line. The penalty area surrounds each goal and includes the penalty spot, the goal area, and an arc at the top of the box. Additional markings include the center circle, halfway line, and corner arcs. Field sizes can vary within FIFA’s allowed limits, especially at youth or recreational levels.
Players must wear appropriate equipment for safety and identification. This includes a jersey, shorts, socks, shin guards, and proper cleats. Shin guards are required to protect the lower legs from kicks or accidental contact. Goalkeepers wear a different-colored jersey to distinguish them from other players. The match ball must meet specific size and weight standards.
The field surface should be even and safe for play. Grass and artificial turf are both acceptable. Corner flags must be placed at each corner, and nets should be securely attached to the goal frame. Coaches and substitutes remain in the technical area on the sidelines, while spectators stay behind designated barriers. Maintaining a proper field environment ensures fair play and reduces injury risk for all participants.
