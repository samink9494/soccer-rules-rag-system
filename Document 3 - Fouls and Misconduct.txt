Fouls and Misconduct
Fouls occur when a player commits an action that is considered careless, reckless, or excessively forceful against an opponent. Common fouls include tripping, pushing, kicking, charging, or striking another player. Some fouls happen during attempts to win the ball, while others occur when players behave aggressively or lose control of their movements. If a foul is committed and the opposing team had clear possession or an advantage, the referee may allow play to continue, but otherwise the game stops so a free kick or penalty can be awarded.
Misconduct is a more serious category. It includes actions that go beyond normal fouls, such as intentionally stopping a promising attack, dissenting against the referee, using offensive language, or committing dangerous tackles. The referee can give a yellow card as a caution or a red card to expel a player from the match. Reckless challenges—those made without regard for the opponent’s safety—often result in yellow cards. Excessive force or violent conduct leads to immediate red cards.
Players must also avoid holding or grabbing jerseys, blocking opponents unfairly, or jumping into challenges with both feet off the ground. Goalkeepers are protected from unfair contact when they catch the ball. Referees are trained to judge the intensity and intent of each challenge. Their decisions help maintain safety and fairness during the match. Teams with players who foul excessively may lose control of the game and struggle to maintain possession. Understanding what constitutes a foul helps players avoid unnecessary stoppages and maintain good sportsmanship.
